# WineScan

This is my final project,
created as an actual, usable webapp.

It's main tasks are:
+ [ ] Store in database all of the wines.
+ [ ] Allow user to see the wines
+ [ ] Allow user to manually add or remove any amount of wine bottles at once
+ [ ] Parsing a photo of a barcode to remove a given bottle
+ [ ] Create barcodes for specific bottles
